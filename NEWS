Changes for R-package Luminescence

Version 0.9.2
	- Function create.sample() was added
	- Example data was enlarged to facilitate function examples
	- Function lw.max() was added

Version 0.9.1 (2013-09-13)
	- Function mix.EM(): as.numeric() added to proportion parameter, to also support matrices as input
	- Function EMMA(), test.lw(), test.L(): weight quantile calulation implemented as sapply() rather than separate function definition
	- Function EMMA(), test.lw(), test.L(): parameters ls, Vqr, Vqn, Vqsn corrected for geometry (now: ls[2,m], Vq...[q,m])
	- Function EMMA(): two redundant but convenient function values added: $loadings and $scores
	- Function test.parameters(): y-axes limits set automatically to prevent false display of data
